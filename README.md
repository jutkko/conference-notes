# Another repo for conference notes
I am trying to be organised. Yes I know I got other repos for notes,
[vim](https://github.com/jutkko/vim-notes), [tools-notes](https://github.com/jutkko/tools-notes),
I promise this is the last one. :O

If you happen to land here, and end up reading some of the notes, please beware
that they are just my personal opinionated views of the
talks/keynotes/technologies/companies. I reserve the right to change them from
time to time.

Other than that I am very happy to talk/discuss/argue about the things you
don't find right.
